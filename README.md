Realm Of The Righteous is Tower Defense game. It is a subgenre of strategy games where 
the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by stopping enemies from 
reaching the exits, usually achieved by placing defensive structures along their path 
of attack. This means building a variety of different structures that serve 
to automatically impede, attack, or destroy enemies. Strategic choice and positioning 
of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.
